# molecular-reweighting
This was my first time playing with python! The code definitely needs work but I hope to continually improve it. 

In our lab we work on finding ways to better the means of force field parameters used in drug designs. We do so with a mix of computations and experiments.
This particular code was a project I took on with a lab member. We looked at OPC water molecules and tried to see how they would react in adverse situations.
